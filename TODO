* Fix ardour to not have a "max value" (wtf is that even)
* teleport traps under water are invisible (?)
* intangible things shouldn't spawn on each other (ex. multiple traps, traps on
  the exit stairs, etc)
* handle a player gaining the same ability multiple times
* There is a timing issue with a boulder rolling over a teleport trap and then
  not changing direction of travel as a result of the reposition. I think
  it's a matter of a movement action triggering after the teleport happened,
  thus making it reposition again in the original direction of travel.
  Unfortunately, this bug also produces the right behaviour, in that a
  teleport trap doesn't change the dir of travel.
